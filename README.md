# okta-springboot-react

The goal of this project is to implement an application where a user can manage (create/read/update/delete) jobs. For it, we will create a backend Restful API called `jobs-api` and a frontend application called `jobs-ui`. Furthermore, we will use [`Okta`](https://www.okta.com/) to secure the complete application.

## Applications

- ### jobs-api

  [`Spring Boot`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) Web Java application that exposes a REST API for managing jobs. It has some endpoints that are secured. `Okta` is used to handle authentication and authorization.
  
  The table below shows the endpoins, whether they are secured or not, and the authorization role required to access the secured ones.
 
  | Endpoint                | Secured | Role                        |
  | ----------------------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
  | `GET /actuator/*`       |      No |                             |
  | `POST /callback/token`  |      No |                             |
  | `GET /api/jobs/newest`  |      No |                             |
  | `POST /api/jobs`        |     Yes | `JOBS_STAFF`                |
  | `PUT /api/jobs/{id}`    |     Yes | `JOBS_STAFF`                |
  | `DELETE /api/jobs/{id}` |     Yes | `JOBS_STAFF`                |
  | `GET /api/jobs/{id}`    |     Yes | `JOBS_STAFF, JOBS_CUSTOMER` |
  | `PUT /api/jobs/search`  |     Yes | `JOBS_STAFF, JOBS_CUSTOMER` |

- ### jobs-ui

  [`ReactJS`](https://reactjs.org/) frontend application where customers can look for a job and staff members can handle jobs. In order to access it, a person must login. The authentication is handled by `Okta`.

- Open a terminal and inside `okta-springboot-react` root folder run
  ```
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- Wait for `elasticsearch` Docker container to be up and running. To check it, run
  ```
  docker-compose ps
  ```

## Running applications

- **jobs-api**

  - In a terminal, navigate to `okta-springboot-react/jobs-api` folder

  - Export the following environment variables. Those values were obtained while [adding Application](#add-application)
    ```
    export OKTA_CLIENT_ID=...
    export OKTA_DOMAIN=...
    ```

  - Run the [`Maven`](https://maven.apache.org/) command below to start `jobs-api`
    ```
    ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
    ```

- **jobs-ui**

  - Open a new terminal and navigate to `okta-springboot-react/jobs-ui` folder

  - Create a file called `.env.local` with the following content. Those values were obtained while [adding Application](#add-application)
    ```
    REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID=<OKTA_CLIENT_ID>
    REACT_APP_OKTA_ORG_URL=https://<OKTA_DOMAIN>
    ```

  - If you are running `jobs-ui` for the first time, execute the [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) command below
    ```
    npm install
    ```

  - To start `jobs-api` run
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    It will open `job-ui` in a browser automatically.

## Applications URLs

| Application | URL                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| jobs-api    | http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html |
| jobs-ui     | http://localhost:3000                       |

## Using jobs-ui

- Open a browser and access http://localhost:3000

- Click `Login` in the navigation bar

- The Okta login page will appear. Enter the username & password of the person added at the step [`Configuring Okta > Add people`](#add-people) and click `Sign In`.

- Done!

> **Note**: If you are using the person `luigi.bros@test.com`, you will not be able to create/update/delete a job because it doesn't have the required role for it.

## Getting Access Token

In order to use just the `jobs-api` endpoints, you must have an `JWT` access token. Below are the steps to get it.

- In a terminal, create the following environment variables. Those values were obtained while [adding Application][#add-application]
  ```
  OKTA_CLIENT_ID=...
  OKTA_DOMAIN=...
  ```

- Get Okta Access Token Url
  ```
  OKTA_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL="https://${OKTA_DOMAIN}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize?\
  client_id=${OKTA_CLIENT_ID}\
  &redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/callback/token\
  &scope=openid\
  &response_type=token\
  &response_mode=form_post\
  &state=state\
  &nonce=6jtp65rt9jf"

  echo $OKTA_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL
  ```

- Copy the Okta Access Token Url from the previous step and paste it in a browser

- The Okta login page will appear. Enter the username & password of the person added at the step [`Configuring Okta > Add people`](#add-people) and click `Sign In` button

- It will redirect to `/callback/token` endpoint of `jobs-api` and the `Access token` will be displayed, together with other information
  ```
  {
    "state": "state",
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJyNFdY...",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": "3600",
    "scope": "openid"
  }
  ```
  > **Note**: In [jwt.io](https://jwt.io), you can decode and verify the `JWT` access token

## Calling jobs-api endpoints using curl

- **`GET /api/jobs/newest`**

  The `api/jobs/newest` endpoint is public, so we can access it without any problem.
  ```
  curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/jobs/newest?number=2
  ```
  It should return
  ```
  HTTP/1.1 200
  [{"id":"uuulE2sBTYouQKNL1uoV", ...},{"id":"u-ulE2sBTYouQKNL1-qb", ...}]
  ```

- **`GET /api/jobs` without Access Token**

  Try to get the list of jobs without informing the access token.
  ```
  curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/jobs
  ```
  It should return
  ```
  HTTP/1.1 401
  ```

- **`GET /api/jobs` with Access Token**

  First, get the access token as explained in [`Getting Access Token`](#getting-access-token) section. Then, create an environment variable for the access token.
  ```
  ACCESS_TOKEN=...
  ```
  
  Call the get the list of jobs informing the access token
  ```
  curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/jobs -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
  ```
  Response
  ```
  HTTP/1.1 200
  {"content":[{"id":"uISqEWsBpDcNLtN2kZv3","title":"Expert Java Developer - Cloud","company":"Microsoft","logoUrl"...}
  ```

  > **Note**: If you are using the person `luigi.bros@test.com`, you will not be able to create/update/delete a job because it doesn't have the required role for it.

## Using jobs-api with Swagger

- First, get the access token as explained in [`Getting Access Token`](#getting-access-token) section.

- Open `jobs-api` Swagger website http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

- Click `Authorize` button. Paste the access token in the `Value` field. Then, click `Authorize` and `Close` to finalize.

- Done! You can now access the sensitive endpoints.

> **Note**: If you are using the person `luigi.bros@test.com`, you will not be able to create/update/delete a job because it doesn't have the required role for it.

## Shutdown

- Go to the terminals where `jobs-api` and `jobs-ui` are running and press `Ctrl+C`

- To stop and remove containers, network and volumes, run in a terminal the following command inside `okta-springboot-react` root folder
  ```
  docker-compose down -v
  ```
